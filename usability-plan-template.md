## Recruiting
### Outreach email
Hi `name`, 
`Name` recommended I reach out to you. I'm a designer working on the `project description`. `Give brief description of the project.`  Would you (or someone at your organization) be interested in participating in usability testing?

**What it involves**: Participants will go through a prototype to `do something`. This involves `brief description of what the session will consist of`.
**Who should participate**: `Describe your users`
**What we are looking for**: Any and all feedback! Sessions like this help us ensure we develop a system that makes sense and is easy for you to use.

If you are able to participate, please let me know which of the following times work, and if you prefer to meet in person or virtually. 

`enter times / days here`

Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you! 
`Your name`

## Conducting the usability session
### Task analysis chart
Y = complete without help
X = could not complete this step

Blank sections were not tested, either because there was not time or the participant did not get to that test because of an earlier failure
| Task description | P1 | P2 | P3  | P4 | P5 | Comments and suggestions
| ----- |-----| -----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Task 1 | Y | N | Y | Y | N | Note what worked well and what didn't, suggest plain language, and include quotes from participants |
| Task 2 | 
| Task 3 | 

### Script
#### Introduction
* Introduce yourself and the project
* Have you participated in a usability test before? If not, explain what it is
* Set an expectation of how long it will take
* Describe possible limitations of the prototype 
* Get consent form signed if necessary
* There are no wrong answers, we are testing the software, not you 
* Prompt participants to ask questions at any time, and stop the session if they feel uncomfortable at any time
* Let them know if you will be recording
* Give them a chance to ask questions before getting started
* Ask any context or introductory questions that will help you understand their perspective


### Test
Walk the participant through each task you want to complete, explaining any missing context. 
* Try not to prompt users to “click here” 
* Ask questions like “is this section clear to you?” “How can we clarify this content?” “Describe what you see here” “What would you do next?”
### Close
* Ask any closing questions
* Any last comments, suggestions or questions?
* Ask for referrals for other usability participants
* Thank the participant for taking the time to participate
